I struggled to get the code blocks in my blog looking exactly how I wanted when creating this site, so I decided to share exactly how I went about styling them.

firstly you must install next/mdx, rehype-pretty-code, and a variety of dependencies:

```bash
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react rehype-pretty-code shiki
```

Once everything has been installed we can begin to write the code that reads our MDX files (Markdown with JSX elements) and applies our styling to the code blocks.

In this example, I am retrieving the markdown files from a local directory using the file system in node.

```js showLineNumbers
async function getPosts() {
  const files = await fs.readdir("./posts");

  const posts = files.map(async (filename) => {
    const file = await fs.readFile(`./posts/${filename}`);
    return await file.toString();
  });

  return Promise.all(posts);
}

async function getPost(slug) {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.find((post) => post.slug === slug);
}
```

Once we have received our posts we will use the **MDXRemote** element to render the markdown into html.

```js showLineNumbers
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const body = await getPost(params.slug);

  return (
    <main className="post-container">
      <MDXRemote source={body} />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Now that we can render our markdown files into HTML on the site, we need to configure it to run through rehype-pretty-code. We do this by passing it into the **MDXRemote** element's option prop. Additionally we are setting the theme we want using shiki - a list of packaged themes can be found [here](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes/tree/main/packages/tm-themes).

```js showLineNumbers
import { MDXRemote } from "next-mdx-remote/rsc";
import rehypePrettyCode from "rehype-pretty-code";

export default async function Page({ params }) {
  const body = await getPost(params.slug);

  return (
    <main className="post-container">
      <MDXRemote
        source={body}
        options={{
          mdxOptions: {
            remarkPlugins: [],
            rehypePlugins: [
              [
                rehypePrettyCode,
                {
                  theme: "one-dark-pro", //Enter whatever them you'd like here
                },
              ],
            ],
          },
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Now we can add custom styling to the code blocks as detailed in the rehype-prety-code [documentation](https://rehype-pretty.pages.dev/#styles). below are some examples of what I did.

The following CSS snippet shows the required theming to get line numbers to show in your code boxes:

```css showLineNumbers
code {
  counter-reset: line;
}

code > [data-highlighted-line] {
  background-color: #ffffff11;
}

code > [data-line]::before {
  counter-increment: line;
  content: counter(line);

  /* Other styling */
  display: inline-block;
  width: 1rem;
  margin-right: 1rem;
  text-align: right;
  color: gray;
}

code[data-line-numbers-max-digits="2"] > [data-line]::before {
  width: 2rem;
}

code[data-line-numbers-max-digits="3"] > [data-line]::before {
  width: 3rem;
}
```

Hopefully, this helps you to get the ball running on your own simple markdown blog in NextJS!

_Happy Coding!_
