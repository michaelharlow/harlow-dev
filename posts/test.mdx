As someone who had never left the US before studying abroad, I strongly recommend every student have some level of international education. Living and experiencing Spain over the last semester was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had! Through the program, I was lucky enough to make lifelong friends, live with the most amazing host family, and meet incredible teachers and mentors from all over the world!

Now I’m coming home with strengthened cross-cultural communication, expanded cultural awareness, and improved adaptability. These skills will undoubtedly enhance my future professional endeavors. I’m incredibly grateful to the University of Central Missouri and Universidad de Alcalá for the support and opportunity to study in Spain and go on many amazing adventures. If you ever get the opportunity to study or work abroad, take it – the growth and memories are priceless!

I just want to keep writing but without any tab stops how am I to know when it is enough writing
plop
I probalbly wont know and that is ok beacause I can just keep on writing all day long!!!
maybe it will be tiring though as I type very weirdly

```js {4} showLineNumbers
async function getPosts() {
  const files = await fs.readdir("./posts");

  const posts = files.map(async (filename) => {
    const file = await fs.readFile(`./posts/${filename}`);
    const markdown = await file.toString();
    const { data, content } = matter(markdown);
    return {
      ...data,
      body: content,
    };
  });

  return Promise.all(posts);
}
```

_the end!_
